# Shap-Value

This repository holds a short Jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to compute and visualize SHAP values for a machine learning model. It's a small, self-contained workspace intended for exploration and learning.

## What's here
- `Customer-churn-analysis.ipynb` — the notebook with data preparation, a model training example, and SHAP-based explanations.

## Quick start
1. Make sure you have Python 3.8 or newer.
2. (Optional but recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the packages used by the notebook (or use your own environment):

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn shap matplotlib seaborn
```

4. Open the notebook in Jupyter:

```bash
jupyter notebook Customer-churn-analysis.ipynb
# or
jupyter lab
```

## Notes
- The notebook file is named `Customer-churn-analysis.ipynb` in this repo. If you prefer a clearer name, feel free to rename it; just update references here.
